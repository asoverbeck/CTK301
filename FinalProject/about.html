    <p class="maintext">Hello, I am Andrew Overbeck! I am a graduate of the Creative Technologies Game Design (Major) and Music (Minor) programs at Illinois State University. I was raised in Morris, IL. I enjoy playing video/board games, whether it is with family, friends, or even people I have never met before. I enjoy listening and performing music. At ISU, I performed in the Percussion Ensemble and was a four-year member in the Drumline for the Big Red Marching Machine. For two of those years, I was a section leader. Throughout this website, you will find many different projects that I have either created on my own or have collaborated with others to make.</p>
